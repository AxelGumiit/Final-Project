                <p>A classic chess game built using C++ in a team workshop project.</p>
                <p>This project was developed as part of a workshop where we created a fully-functional chess game in C++. The game features a user-friendly interface and standard chess rules.</p>
                <p>The game allows two players to compete against each other, with move validation, a game timer, and checkmate detection included. It was a great opportunity to apply object-oriented programming concepts to a real-world application.</p>
